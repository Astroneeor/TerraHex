# G-Hacks 2025: GPS to Remove Stress

## Overview
This project, **TerraHex**, was developed as part of the **G-Hacks 2025 Hackathon** by **Team G5** (Asim Hamdan, Neeor Alam, and Constantine Saev) on **February 22-23, 2025**. The project focuses on **GPS data analysis and smoothing techniques** to better understand real-world navigation errors and improve positioning accuracy.

## Project Goals
- **Analyze GPS data** collected from surveying.
- **Apply various smoothing methods** (Gaussian, EMA, Kalman Filtering) to reduce errors in altitude readings.
- **Visualize GPS data** through **2D, 3D, and animated plots**.
- **Identify sources of error** in GPS readings and their impact on real-world tracking.

## Key Sections of the Website
1. **Introduction**
   - Explains the importance of navigation and GPS tracking.
   - Discusses how sensors collect and process location data.

2. **Graphs and Figures**
   - Displays **2D and 3D plots** of the surveyed walking path.
   - Includes an **animated route visualization**.
   - Features a **smoothed version** of the path to correct noise.

3. **Sources of Error**
   - Discusses GPS inaccuracies due to **buildings, trees, and terrain**.
   - Highlights how **data smoothing reduces, but doesnâ€™t eliminate errors**.

4. **Conclusion**
   - Reflects on the **importance of geomatics** in modern navigation.
   - Discusses lessons learned from using **Hexagon's surveying equipment**.
   - Evaluates the effectiveness of **Gaussian smoothing** in reducing noise.

5. **Logbook**
   - A **detailed timeline** documenting our workflow over **February 22-23, 2025**.
   - Tracks progress from **data collection to website finalization**.

## Technical Features
- **GPS Data Processing:** Extracts, analyzes, and visualizes **longitude, latitude, and altitude**.
- **Smoothing Methods Implemented:**
  - **Gaussian Smoothing** (Best performing method)
  - **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**
  - **Kalman Filtering** (Advanced predictive smoothing)
- **Visualizations:**
  - **Matplotlib** for static graphs
  - **Folium** for interactive maps
  - **Matplotlib Animation** for route playback
- **Web Technologies Used:**
  - HTML, CSS for the website
  - Python for the data processing and plotting

## How to Use
1. **Navigate through the website** to explore **graphs, visualizations, and analysis**.
2. **View the interactive walking path** (smoothed GPS data plotted on a real map).
3. **Check the logbook** for insights into the team's development process.
4. **Access the full dataset** via the **table of averaged data**.

## Future Improvements
- Implement **celestial body tracking** for more fun information
- Integrate **machine learning models** to predict and correct GPS errors from buildings and trees.
- Develop a **mobile-friendly version** website.
