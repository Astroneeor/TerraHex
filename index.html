Throughout history, location and tracking has been a key part of both the world, and our day-to-day lives. 
From compassess to maps, we have made many advancements in the fields of naviagtion, locating, and travelling. We began by gazing out at the heavens, wondering if we could reach them,
and grew to navigate the murky seas that trapped our ancestors on the isolated land-masses, to traverse the vast canyons and plains that covered the wilderness, and the unexplored land we now inhabit.
Now, as we once more set our sights towards the skies, and the promise of life among the stars, we have become masters of our little blue planet,
surrounding it in sensors, and hunks of metal that orbit at 28 800 km/hr, to provide us with the information we yearned for so long ago, the secrets to navigation.
<br>
<br>
We have now even gotten to a point, that navigation and the pieces of metal allowing us to use it, is even accessible to those who barely understand them, first year students
of engineering of all things.

    Logbook:
</h2>
On our road to creating this code, and finishing our project, we went through many iterations and changes, that all contributed to the
<i>incredible</i> final product that we are presenting. Here, we will present the timeline, along with the changes we made while working through this project.<br><br>

    10:15am: Arrived at venue, and recieved information about project, and it was off to the races!<br>
    10:20am: Began researching the syntax and formatting of the sensor's data, to be able to organize the data, and use it for the graph<br>
    11:20am: Completed researching on the syntax, and decided to use the bestpos and gpgga log operators to collect our data<br>
    11:54am: Took first surveying measurements, surveyed the campus with the sensors<br>
    11:55am: Finished surveying, returned with data and began to analyze and code to use the data<br>
    12:00pm: Began researching what type of graphs to use, and started splitting the data to be more usable<br>
    12:31pm: Finished splitting the data, began writing the front-end code, and preparing to plot the data<br>
    1:00pm: Began plotting the data, and finished the math functions<br>
    2:30pm: Went through some issues plotting the data, as it kept appearing linear, and not circular, tracing the path that we traveled while surveying<br>
    3:00pm: Realized there was an issue with the data, as when we collected the data, when saving it, it deleted a significant portion of the initial data, as the length of the data was too long to all be saved, so a resurveying was necessary to get accurate data<br>
    3:19pm: Surveyed again, as original data turned out to be incomplete, due to the sheer quantity of data we had originally had, and as a result of it's size, was partially deleted<br>
    3:20pm: Finished surveying again, and analyzed the new data, which was 3 times as long as our original data, and included the <i>complete</i> route taken for surveying<br>
