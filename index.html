        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout history, location and tracking have been key to our development. From compasses to maps,
          humanity has advanced in navigation and exploration. Our journey began by gazing at the heavens and has evolved into
          harnessing technology that guides our everyday lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, as we set our sights on the skies, our advanced sensors orbiting at high speeds deliver the vital information
          needed to navigate our world. We have google maps and other navigation systems that help us get from point A to point B,
          however it's important that we understand how these positioning systems work, and how they can be used to their full potential.

        <h2>Graphs and Figures</h2>
          <p>The above picture is a graphs created from the data gathered from our surveying, as well as a map plotting the data we gathered
          on Google Earth. We also have a 2D graph, an animation of the route taken, and a smoothed version of the path. Additionally, a 3D plot
          displays all data points, including altitude, to show possible errors in height readings.
          </p>
          <p>
            The buttons below will take you to a gallery of the various methods we used to smooth the data, and the  walking path is a representation of the
            gaussian smoothing method and displaying the path on an actual map. It shows the building we walked around and uses the Foulium library.

          <h2>Sources of Error</h2>
              <!-- Comment on Data, and possible errors involving the height of the 3D plots, the changes near the trees, and the accuracy of the GPS data. -->
              As evident from the above figures, there are many errors and inconsistencies in the data collected. The figures, especially
              the one shown on Google Earth show the reasoning for the descrepencies in the data. As shown in the figure, many roofs and trees
              were along the route taken while surveying, which skewed the data collected, as the sensor could not get a very accurate reading,
              due to the interference, which prevented the satellite's signal from correctly being recorded with the sensor. This is noticable on the
              3D plot as well, specifically the huge differences in height between the points, which shows that the surveying had a change in height of 50 meters,
              which, as seen from the Google Earth plot, is not possible.
              <br>
              <br>
              Another possible source of error, is the smoothing of the path from the 2D plot. The smoothing takes the average of the points that
              are close to each other, which omits some extrenous points, in an attempt to adress the afformentioned possible causes of error, though 
              in doing so, may omit data points that are more accurate than the trend depicted. However, the inaccuracy is most likely less than one meter,
              which is negligable with regards to the total distance traveled, and is not as significant as the errors caused by the inaccuracies
              due to the buildings and other interferences to the satellite's signals.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <!-- Comment on the importance of the data, the gratitude for using the equipment and participating in the hackathon, as well as the importance of geomatics in general with regards to surveying and advancing progress -->
          This hackathon and opportunity to survey using the equipment generously provided by Hexagon has broadened our horizons in both the field of geomatics,
          and programming. Arguably the oldest type of engineering, gemoatics has made significant to humanity and our progress, allowing us to examine
          the change and topography of a multitude of landscapes, and using this equipment to do a bit of our own surveying, and writing this program
          has given us a new perspective on the thought, problems, and work put behind both the GPS systems used by people everyday, to the advanced 
          naviagtion systems used by NASA and other organizations to map out the bottom of the Antarctic, the sea floor, and even the surface of the moon.
          <br>
          <br>
          With all this in mind, we hope that our program and the data provided are to your satisfaction, and we thank you for the opportunity
          that was given to us to work with this specialized equipment, along with getting help from one of the industry's most innovative companies. 
          From our data, we determined that the graph smoothing method that was most appropriate and effective was the Gaussian smoothing method,
          and although there remained some sporadity within our data, since our surveying wasn't quite a straight line, as we were dodging puddles
          and ice while surveying, as well as going down a wrong path for a moment, which is why the SE part of the graph goes one way, and 
          then turns back to continue down a seperate path.
