        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout history, location and tracking have been key to our development. From compasses to maps,
          humanity has advanced in navigation and exploration. Our journey began by gazing at the heavens and has evolved into
          harnessing technology that guides our everyday lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, as we set our sights on the skies, our advanced sensors orbiting at high speeds deliver the vital information
          needed to navigate our world. This project makes navigation accessible and stress-free.
